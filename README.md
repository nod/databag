# PUT YOUR DATA IN A BAG

Pretty simple library for splatting stuff to disk and getting it back out
with minimal fuss.

It's sort of a long term file based dictionary with enhanced range type
filtering.


**updated for python3**

## wait...

Yep - it's a nosql type, document oriented database wrapper on top of sqlite3.

## features

- Easy to use and quite efficient at accessing relatively large number of items
  (not talking big data here, but a couple of thousand items works well)
- Requires no other libs, everything is python batteries included.
- Built on top of sqlite3 so it's fast and stable (which is included in Python
  stdlib)
- Easy to use - just create one and use it like a dictionary. Most dict methods
  supported. Also can add to it like a set by not specifying a key.  One will
  be created on the fly.
- Pretty well tested
- Ideal for running on small vm instances.  Doesn't require any other daemon to
  provide data access
- Core code is about 400 lines - very easy to understand.
- Automatically compresses data with bz2 in cases that benefit from it
- offers versioned records if you so choose
- You can always query the data with native sqlite3 libs from other languages
  if you need to.  It's just strings in the database.
- Since the underlying datafile is sqlite3, multiple processes can work with
  the same file (multiple read, write locks, etc)
- Every object gets a ts object attached to it for convenience when it's saved.
  This is accessed via `bag.when('key')`

## versioning

Simplified versioning is provided.  Just create your DataBag like:::

```Python console
>>> dbag = DataBag(versioned=True, fpath='/tmp/some.db')
```

and then you can do things like...

```Python console
>>> dbag['blah'] = 'blip'
>>> dbag['blah'] = 'new blip'
>>> dbag['blah'] = 'newer blip'
>>> dbag.get('blah', version=-2)
u'blip'
>>> dbag.get('blah', version=-1)
u'new blip'
>>> dbag.get('blah')
u'newer blip'
>>> dbag['blah']
u'newer blip'
```

The default is to keep 10 versions but that can be set with the `history`
parameter when initializing your bag.

If you don't specify an `fpath` argument, the database is only created in
memory.  
By specifying `fpath`, you specify the location of the file on the filesystem.

A `bag.get(...)` method works much like a dictionary's `.get(...)` but with an
additional keyword argument of `version` that indicates how far back to go.

## examples

```Python console
>>> from databag import DataBag
>>> bag = DataBag() # will store sqlite db in memory
>>> bag['xyz'] = 'some string' # will save in the db
>>> s = bag['xyz'] # retrieves from db
>>> s
'some string'
>>> 'xyz' in bag # True
True
>>> bag['abc'] = {'x':22, 'y':{'a':'blah'}} # works
>>> bag['abc']
{u'y': {u'a': u'blah'}, u'x': 22}
>>> [k for k in bag]
['abc', 'xyz']
>>> bag.when('xyz')
datetime.datetime(2011, 12, 31, 2, 45, 47, 187621)
>>> del bag['xyz']
>>> 'xyz' in bag
False
>>> meh = DataBag(bag='other') # set name of storage table
```

## DictBag example

```Python console
>>> from databag import DictBag, Q
>>> d = DictBag()
>>> d.ensure_index(('name', 'age'))
>>> person1 = {'name':'joe', 'age':23}
>>> person2 = {'name':'sue', 'age':44}
>>> d.add(person1)
'fachVqv6RxsmCXAZgJMJ5p'
>>> d.add(person2)
'fpC7cAtx2ZQLadprQR7aa6'
>>> d.find(Q('age')>40).next()
(u'fpC7cAtx2ZQLadprQR7aa6', {u'age': 44, u'name': u'sue'})
>>> age = Q('age')
>>> [p for p in d.find(20 < age < 50) ]
[(u'fachVqv6RxsmCXAZgJMJ5p', {u'age': 23, u'name': u'joe'}),
    (u'fpC7cAtx2ZQLadprQR7aa6', {u'age': 44, u'name': u'sue'})]
>>>
```

## Mongo Style Queries

```Python console
>>> d.find({'age':23})
>>> d.find({'age':{"$gt":20}} )
```

## limitations

- although a lot of the basic data types in python are supported for the values
  (lists, dictionaries, tuples, ints, strings)... datetime objects can be saved
  fine but they come out of the bag as an iso format string of the original
  datetime.
- when saving a dictionary, the keys must be a string in the dictionary.  If
  they are not, they will be when coming back from the bag
- if using versioning, be sure to instantiate your DataBag object with
  versioning enabled and the same `history` size each time. Failure to do so
  will cause interesting things to happen, in particular, your databag will act
  unversioned and overwrite recent updates w/o cascading the historical change
  to records.
